# Dillo Dally Blog
A fun little project using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. Over time, I will consider refactoring to include SASS and/or templating. Will probably not use React or Angular.

## Current Goals
* dark mode
* desktop index carousel for featured items
* mobile hamburger menu
* mobile scrolling featured items
